The FBgn0031208 gene has 5 exons in the original annotation file (i.e. `Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP5.25.62.chr.gtf`)
and only 4 counting bins in the flattened one (i.e. `Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP5.25.62.chr_dexseq_noaggregate.gff`). 
Following inspection of the annotated transcripts in [Ensembl 62](http://apr2011.archive.ensembl.org/Drosophila_melanogaster/Gene/Summary?db=core;g=FBgn0031208;r=2L:6687-10326), we can explain how the initial exons break down into 4 different counting bins.

With the option `--aggregate=no`, those exons that are shared across different genes will not be included as counting bins. In general it is a good idea to use this option, since big changes in the expression of the two (or more) genes that share the same exon might affect the outcome of our differential exon usage analysis.
