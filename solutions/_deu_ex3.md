Similarly to Phred scores, mapping qualities reflect the probability of a wrong alignment. However, despite of the fact that they contain the same information, its range can vary depending on the mapping tool used.
In this example, and considering that we have mapped the reads using TopHat, DEXSeq would only consider those reads that map uniquely (i.e. mapping quality = 255; see [previous exercise](https://github.com/mgonzalezporta/TeachingMaterial/blob/master/solutions/_bam_ex3.md)).
